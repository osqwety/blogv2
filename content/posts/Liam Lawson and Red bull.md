Title: Liam Lawson and Red Bull.
---


There are rumors that Liam Lawson is going to be dropped ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. Christian Horner seemed unsure when answering questions for the media when we was asked about if Liam would be kept or dropped. Liam Lawson in the past two races of the season has been preforming absolutely horribly, qualifying with Haas and Alpine cars in a Red Bull.
