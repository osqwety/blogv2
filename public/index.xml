      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are rumors that Liam Lawson is going to be dropped ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. Christian Horner seemed unsure when answering questions for the media when we was asked about if Liam would be kept or dropped. Liam Lawson in the past two races of the season has been preforming absolutely horribly, qualifying with Haas and Alpine cars in a Red Bull. Lawson  has had only 2 races in this Red Bull with zero testing time before the season since Red Bull made this decision extremely late. Additionally, Liam has never driven at both previous circuits, and did not have maximum practice time since China was a sprint race. It is absolutely insane to make a decision on such outlier type of data. Red Bull would be doing something idiotic if they were to kick Liam out after only two races.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
