There are rumors that Liam Lawson is going to be dropped ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. Christian Horner seemed unsure when answering questions for the media when we was asked about if Liam would be kept or dropped. Liam Lawson in the past two races of the season has been preforming absolutely horribly, qualifying with Haas and Alpine cars in a Red Bull. Lawson  has had only 2 races in this Red Bull with zero testing time before the season since Red Bull made this decision extremely late. Additionally, Liam has never driven at both previous circuits, and did not have maximum practice time since China was a sprint race. It is absolutely insane to make a decision on such outlier type of data. Red Bull would be doing something idiotic if they were to kick Liam out after only two races. 

The Red Bull is not an easy car to drive, we know this from Max, Liam, and previous drivers who attempted to describe how the Red Bull felt to drive. Drivers like Liam and Albon previously have stated that the Red Bull is extremely pointy on the front end. Most high performance drivers prefer an oversteery setup (there are some exceptions), since it is easier to extract the maximum out of the tires and therefore, go faster. The Red Bull is an extra oversteery car, and has been for many years, since Max Verstappen does really prefer this type of car. As we know, Max is Red Bull's bloodline, and so the car is developed around him. However, this season, and the second half of 2023, the Red Bull has become much harder to drive, since the car has become too oversteery, and therefore, extra difficult to drive for those who are not used to this extreme setup like Max. The car now is even hard for Max to drive, however, he is an extremely talented driver, and has adapted to bring that Red Bull much closer to the podium, when the car is arguably, the fourth fastest car. Max has an extreme delicate driving style, which is required for this type of car. Some say that Max is over aggressive, and at times, this is true, however, how he tells the car to move is extremely delicate, allowing him to preform well.

Liam Lawson is finding the car super difficult to drive because of the extreme oversteery nature that the car now has. This has led to mistakes, and forcing him to drive under the limit significantly, leading to his bad performances. However, Liam is not a bad driver, we saw that in the Racing Bulls/VCARB/whatever the hell they call it. Additionally, Liam has done very well in other racing series like DTM, and super formula. We know that he is capable of being much closer to Max. Part of being a good driver is being able to adapt to different cars. Liam has raced in many other series, and has shown that he is able to adapt to different cars. However, in the Red Bull, he needs more time to allow for this change to take place. Again, Red Bull has not given him any testing time, and Liam has had limited time to practice in total. We he has had such little time to practice, how does Red Bull expect him to preform well in their car? Kimi Antonelli who is the prodigy of Mercedes, was given over **10,000** kilometers of driving in Mercedes's cars. We see him doing so well in these past races, and part of the reason is because of this. Obviously, he is extremely talented and the Mercedes is ahead of the Red Bull, but the point still stands.

Red Bull must give Liam at least half a season to learn the car. There is almost no driver who is able to jump into any car, and instantly adapt. This is especially true for younger drivers who do not have that much experience to begin with. Also, The Red Bull environment has been known to be toxic in nature, and many drivers were only able to extract their true performance once they left the Red Bull family. Carlos Sainz is an example. Lawson could possibly consider leaving Red Bull when he gets the chance. There are many teams that would possibly take him, granted, they may not be top teams for the next few years, since they all have solid line ups right now.

Liam must get at least half a season to learn the car, if he does not, Red Bull could potentially be wasting a talent that they had supported for so many years prior.
